# Minimax-Checkers
#Using a mimimax algorithm, which can be easily adjusted on how far a depth you want it to search,
#The AI can make decisions based on heuristic evaluations. 
#To use:
#Create main folder for game, which needs an __init__.py file inside (empty, needs for initializing game)
#place main.py in this main folder.
#create 3 new folders inside main folder:
#1- checkers = this will hold python files: board.py, constants.py, game.py, piece.py, (create an empty __init__.py for this folder)
#2- assets = holds the crown asset made in aseprite. Basic design, can be easily updated or changed.
#3- minimax = this contains algorithm for computer player. holds files: algorithm.py (create an empty __init__.py)
#Not implemented but planned:
#To create a neural network where the computer AI plays against itself to learn and improve its code.
